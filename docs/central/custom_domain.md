# Custom Domain

Read this guide for further information on how to use your own domain with VyHub.  
You do not need to use your own domain; we offer you a free **vyhub.app** or **serverstore.io** domain (e.g.,
gaming.vyhub.app or your-community.serverstore.io).

> A domain name is the name of a website (like vyhub.net or google.com)

We do provide a detailed [guide](#buy-your-own-domain-using-namecheap) on how to set up your custom domain
with [Namecheap](https://namecheap.pxf.io/MXzdRY).

## General Steps

1. Buy your own domain at a domain name registrar of your choice (
   e.g. <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/MXzdRY" rel="nofollow">Namecheap*</a>)
2. Set the domains CNAME record to the corresponding VyHub URL

### Set the domains CNAME record

> You need to set the CNAME record to our servers, that you can reach VyHub with your domain.

Please search and follow the tutorials on how to set the CNAME record provided by your registrar.

**Caution when using Cloudflare**:
You need to set the proxy status to DNS only. Otherwise, the CNAME will not work.

### My domain registrar does not support CNAME records for the root domain

Many domain registrars do not offer the ability to set a CNAME record for the root domain (e.g., your-community.de).

When your domain registrar does not support CNAME records for the root domain, you can use a subdomain (e.g.
`www.your-community.de`) and
redirect your root domain to the subdomain.

**Redirecting the root domain to the subdomain**
Redirect `your-community.de` to `www.your-community.de`

### Debugging with the CNAME checker

You set your CNAME, but the instance is still not loading?
Please check whether the values shown on your instance page match up with the values in
the [CNAME-checker](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=cname)

1. Use the CNAME checker linked in the instance details of your VyHub instance
2. Check whether the values match up (next two screenshots)
