4. Enter the redirect URL shown in the `Authorization` settings.

3. Create the server
4. Click on the `Setup` button of the server.
5. Click on the `Add` button to add the Bot to your Discord server.
    - The link can also be created manually:
      `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id={discord_application_id}&permissions=268438545&scope=bot`
6. Make sure the bot can change roles.
    - In Discord, open the server settings.
    - Go to `Roles` and drag and drop VyHub Bot above groups you want to have synced.

   > For higher security donâ€™t allow the bot to sync admin groups.

## Group Sync

User groups are automatically synced.

VyHub group names can be mapped to server/in-game groups at the `Mappings` tab in the [group](../guide/group/group_sync.md)
settings. Please pay attention to capitalization.

> It is possible to use "role names" or "role ids" in the `mappings`

## Notifications

The discord bot can send notifications about Bans / Warnings / Purchases.

1. Set up the Discord bot by following the steps above and use the following commands directly in Discord.
2. Use command `/enable_notifications` to enable notifications by specifying the channel where to send notifications to
    - `channel` argument is required.
    - The other arguments are optional and allow you to set specific channels for different notification types.
3. [Optional] Use the command `/configure_notifications` to configure the message layout of the messages sent by the
   bot.

### Available Configuration Options

- Different channels for each notification type
- Enable / disable each notification type independently
- Set embeds title and description for each notification type independently

### Available Variable Replacements

- `{username}`
- `{reason}`
- `{length}`
- `{serverbundle}`
- `{packets}`
- `{purchase_amount}`
- `{frontend_url}`
- `{issuer}` (Bans and Warnings only)
- `{ticket_title}` (Tickets only)

## Troubleshooting

__Problem:__ Roles are not synced with Discord.

__Solution:__ Make sure roles have the exact name as provided to VyHub (Capitalization / Whitespaces...) and that the
VyHub role has higher permissions than other roles.
Also have a look in the logs; the Discord errors might help, when the bot can't connect to the Discord API.

__Problem:__ Notifications don't appear, even though I set up the notification channel.

__Solution:__ Make sure the bot has the required message write rights in the chosen channel.
