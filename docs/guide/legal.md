care of secure payment processing on our behalf.

Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your
personal data will remain with us
until the purpose for the data processing ceases to apply. If you assert a
legitimate request for deletion or revoke consent for data processing,
your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your
personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax law or commercial law); in the
the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons have ceased to exist.
