# Tax Rules

You can use the tax rules for any kind of tax, for example, to charge VAT for your products. In the `Packet` settings
you
can even decide whether the packet price should include the tax or whether the tax is added on top of the packet price.

> Setting up tax rules is totally optional and strongly depends on your case. If you are unsure, please consult with a
> tax
> consultant.

You can set `tax rules` for each country or for all of them at once.

To set tax for all countries at once, leave the `country` selection blank. Then the tax rule is applied to all
countries.
