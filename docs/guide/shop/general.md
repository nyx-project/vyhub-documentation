The VyHub shop is the most important feature of VyHub. It allows you to sell VIP-Ranks, Item Drops, and more to your
users for real money. The VyHub shop works by executing commands on your server when a user buys a product.

Before a user can buy your packets, some configuration is needed. 

- Create a Packet Category
- Create a [Packet](./packet.md) with [Rewards](./reward.md)
- Set up [Payment Gateways / Payment Methods](./payment_gateway.md) and optionally [Tax Rules](./tax.md)
