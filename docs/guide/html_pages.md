# HTML Page

Custom pages can be created by first adding an HTML page.

After creating the page you can create a new **[navigation link](navigation.md)** with the type of `HTML content` to link the page.

> JavaScript and other dangerous HTML tags are escaped and not rendered, unless edited by an admin
