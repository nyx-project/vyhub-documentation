## Group Mappings
Group mappings are essential for the synchronization of groups on your servers. With them, you can specify which VyHub group belongs to which server group(s).

A group mapping consists of two parts:

1. Serverbundle: The group mapping is scoped for this serverbundle. Leave empty to make the mapping valid for all bundles.
2. Name of group/rank/role: The name of the group/rank/role on your server.

### Example
Imagine that there are two serverbundles: One for Garry's Mod and one for Discord.

- We want that users that have the `Admin` VyHub group in the GMOD serverbundle should receive the `superadmin` in-game.
- Additionally, users that have the `Admin` VyHub group in the Discord serverbundle should receive the `Owner` role on the Discord server.

We go to the `Mappings` section of the `Admin` VyHub group and create two mappings:

- One for the GMOD serverbundle with `superadmin` as group name.
- One for the Discord serverbundle with `Owner` as group name.


## Membership
With memberships, users can be assigned to a group in a serverbundle for a specified amount of time.
